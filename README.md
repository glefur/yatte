Yes A Tiny Template Engine.

Yatte is a very tiny template engine, usable in an OSGi context.

## Why Yatte?

For my [p2repoPublisher](https://github.com/glefur/osgitools), I needed a template engine to generate the webpage. I know code generators like [Acceleo](http://www.eclipse.org/acceleo) therefore I know what is required to do to manage simple templates like for my use case.

I also know [Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/) but I've never used it and I've noticed that its development was stopped a long time ago.

Since that finding the good tool would take me at least as much time than create it (And yes, I know, reinvent the wheel), I decided to reinvent the wheel.

Here is Yatte!

BTW, it's also a sandbox to experiment some stuff like Java 8 streams, regex...
